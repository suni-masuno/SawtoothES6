================

We…
User Trello for our backlog
Pull from near the top of the backlog
Rework the backlog at will
Write our code in Javascript (if at all possible)
Write stories when we get an idea
Break stories down as far as possible
Use epics/stickers/labels etc to make sense of all those stories
Write our code functionally using Redux/higher order functions/etc

We don’t…
Pull our own stories from review to done.
Set deadlines
Expect people to put this project before your real life

Sawtooth Design Core
=====================
Not a full design doc!

Core Idea of the Game
Better players face more challenge.
This allows players of differing skill levels to play together.

Lesser Points of Interest
You go to higher tier classes when you master classes.
Higher tier classes are ‘cooler’ and have more interesting mechanics, but are overall weaker.
Game plays a bit like diablo, but with more ‘fun’ mechanics (dwarf fortress fun!)
Major focus on social elements, this is to play WITH friends.
Abilities interact between players (somehow)
Higher tier classes are more dependent on lower tier characters, but achieve more because of it??? (maybe not if you get ‘no you play the healer!’ itis)
Wide breath of classes
By class we don’t mean literal class, maybe something more interesting!
Playersf all skills and playstyles can play the same game together and have fun!


Sawtooth Setting
================
Spaceships/mechs
ships/mechs are ‘generated’ by… energy/nanomachines/etc and ‘better’ ones have less powers BUT get more ‘points/resources’ for their ‘faction’ when they win. Trading power for EXP (but not exp for you) Bragging rights, got the most for my faction leaderboard. Garage of mechs!	Higher tier means more resources mined/picked up and therefore more gained when successfully finishing missions. Most of the gains go to the faction (which is hopefully a guild!)

Pros
====
Player customization of both abilities and cosmetics
Fair number of visual resources

Cons
====
Hard to do with a simple art style
Hard to convey the weakening thing

Core Gameplay Loop 0.1
======================
Pick Ship
Join Party
Get to pick up spot (fights!/Travels!)
Pick up goods/mine
Travel to drop off (fights!/traverls!)
Drop of goods
PROFIT (which goes to faction leaderboard, core gameplay goal, and some for you too)
Profit for you is static, beat missing get X profit, profit for FACTION goes up with higher tier machines.

# Phaser + ES6 + Webpack.
#### A bootstrap project to create games with Phaser + ES6 + Webpack.

![Phaser+ES6+Webpack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack/master/assets/images/phaser-es6-webpack.jpg)

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)


## Features
- ESLINT with JavaScript Standard Style configuration
- Next generation of Javascript
- Webpack ready
- Multiple browser testing
- WebFont Loader


# Setup
To use this bootstrap you’ll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.

## 1. Clone this repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

```git clone https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack.git```

## 2. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/


## 3. Install dependencies:

Navigate to the cloned repo’s directory.

Run:

```npm install```

## 4. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser


## Build for deployment:

Run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.

## Credits
